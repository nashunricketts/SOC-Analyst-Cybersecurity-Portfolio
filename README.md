# Third-Party Supplier Compliance and Risk Assessment

## 🎯 Project Overview

A comprehensive governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) assessment of a third-party cloud infrastructure supplier handling sensitive financial data. This project demonstrates end-to-end supplier risk management using NIST cybersecurity frameworks to evaluate compliance gaps, prioritize risks, and develop actionable mitigation strategies.

**Organization**: Synaptelligence (AI-powered financial solutions provider)  
**Supplier Evaluated**: DataGoblyn (secure cloud infrastructure services)  
**Role**: Cybersecurity Analyst  
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Assessment Date**: April 2025

## 🔍 Business Context

Synaptelligence specializes in machine learning solutions for financial portfolio optimization, requiring robust cybersecurity protocols to protect sensitive client data. As supply chain attacks become increasingly sophisticated, evaluating third-party suppliers is critical for maintaining:

- **Client Trust**: Protecting financial data and meeting compliance standards
- **Operational Continuity**: Ensuring reliable and secure AI infrastructure
- **Market Position**: Establishing credibility as a trusted leader in financial AI solutions

This assessment evaluated DataGoblyn's security posture to determine their ability to safeguard Synaptelligence's systems and customer data.

## 🎯 Critical Risk Scenarios Identified

### Risk Matrix
```
Impact Level
Critical │ • Data Breach via Third-Party Access
         │ • Supply Chain Attack on Financial Software
         │ • Ransomware Attack on Financial Systems
         │
Major    │ • Insider Threat
         │ • Compliance Failure (Financial Regulations)
         │ • Business Email Compromise
         │ • Social Engineering Attack (Executives)
         │
Moderate │ • Phishing Attack Targeting Employees
         │
         └────────────────────────────────────────
           Rare    Possible    Likely    Almost Certain
                        Likelihood
```

**Top 3 Critical Risks**:
1. **Data Breach via Third-Party Access** - No vendor assessment program
2. **Supply Chain Attack** - Absence of secure SDLC creates vulnerability injection points
3. **Ransomware Attack** - Poor patch management leaves systems exposed

## 💡 Recommended Mitigation Strategies

### Immediate Actions (0-3 months)
- Implement robust patch management with defined timeframes
- Deploy SIEM for active log monitoring
- Establish encryption key management process
- Develop data minimization policy

### Short-term Actions (3-6 months)
- Integrate security into software development lifecycle (secure SDLC)
- Implement comprehensive third-party risk management program
- Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions
- Establish annual penetration testing program

### Continuous Monitoring
- Monthly vulnerability scanning
- Quarterly security control effectiveness reviews
- Annual security audit reviews and incident response testing
- Real-time log analysis and anomaly detection

## 🔧 Custom Tools Developed

Throughout this assessment, I developed custom tools and templates from scratch:

- **Compliance Assessment Framework**: 8-category evaluation system aligned with NIST CSF
- **Risk Matrix Template**: 4x4 impact/likelihood grid with color-coded severity levels
- **Continuous Monitoring Plan**: KPI-driven oversight framework with defined metrics
- **Gap Analysis Checklist**: Structured questionnaire mapping to NIST 800-53 controls
